# cc-project-management-plugin

A Claude Code plugin bundling three orchestration subagents (`scaffolder`, `director`, `investigator`) and four skills (`plan-management`, `project-scaffolding`, `skill-catalog`, `prior-art-research`) — distributed as a single-plugin marketplace so users can install it globally with `/plugin install` instead of copying `.md` files into every project.

## IMPORTANT
Only update version in plugin.json when we make a new release 

## Stack
- Language / runtime: **none at build time** — the repo is Markdown (agent definitions, rules, docs), JSON (plugin manifests), and stdlib-only Python helpers (`bin/plan-management`, `bin/skill-catalog`).
- Runtime dependencies on consumer machines: **Python 3** (required by both `bin/` helpers) and the **`gh` CLI** authenticated via `gh auth login` (required only by `skill-catalog` for GitHub-backed catalog search; if absent, scaffolder skips catalog search and Discovery still completes).
- No compile step, no test suite, no dependency lockfiles.

Note: `agents/` and `skills/` both live at the **plugin root**, not under `.claude/agents/` or `.claude/skills/`. Those nested locations are how consumers see them after installation — the plugin spec requires them at the root, and `.claude-plugin/` holds only `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`.

## Canonical Commands
- Local plugin test:       `claude --plugin-dir ./`
- Reload without restart:  `/reload-plugins` (inside a Claude Code session)
- Validate JSON manifest:  `python3 -m json.tool .claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Validate marketplace:    `python3 -m json.tool .claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Smoke-test skill-catalog:`bin/skill-catalog search react`  *(requires `gh auth login`; exits 2 if unauthenticated)*
- Release (tag + push):    `git tag v<semver> && git push origin main --tags`

There is no `build`, `test`, `lint`, or `run` target — Markdown + JSON only.

## Rules (load on demand)
Each rule file below is a focused behavioral contract. Read a rule file when its trigger matches your task — do not auto-load.

- `.claude/rules/git.md` — read before making any commit or tag
- `.claude/rules/releasing.md` — read before bumping the plugin version or cutting a release
- `.claude/rules/agent-authoring.md` — read before creating or editing any file under `agents/` or `skills/`
- `.claude/rules/no-legacy.md` — read before editing any prose (agent prompts, skill prompts, rules, docs, READMEs)

## Skills (bundled)
- `skills/plan-management/SKILL.md` — canonical format spec and read/write commands for the `plan:` and `Task:` journal commit messages director uses to store plan state in git history. Read it before editing director's plan/journal behavior or any agent that needs to inspect plan state.
- `skills/project-scaffolding/SKILL.md` — canonical spec for the files scaffolder writes after Discovery (`CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, optional `.claude/local/*.md` spillover when `CLAUDE.local.md` overflows its 200-line cap, rule files, `.claude/settings.local.json`) plus the Requirements Summary input contract, the `CLAUDE.local.md` template, the spillover mechanics, and the reference template catalog. Read it before editing scaffolder's behavior, the file overwrite/git-bootstrap policy, the spillover rules, or the rule reference templates.
- `skills/skill-catalog/SKILL.md` — wraps `bin/skill-catalog`, the `gh`-backed helper that searches SKILL.md files in the trusted-repos list at `~/.claude/skill-repos.json` (default `["anthropics/skills"]`). Read it before editing scaffolder's catalog-consultation step or `bin/skill-catalog`.
- `skills/prior-art-research/SKILL.md` — research-driven investigation procedure (Understand → Research → Synthesize) plus the unified findings-report format. The `investigator` agent loads it on every dispatch; any other agent can also load it when researching a non-trivial bug, library/pattern choice, feature design, or architectural decision. Read it before editing investigator's behavior or the report format.
- `skills/discovery-grilling/SKILL.md` — grilling procedure scaffolder applies in Discovery Phases 1, 2, 3, and 6: five vagueness diagnostics, the director-plan termination bar, cross-phase contradiction probing, and park-it mechanics. Read it before editing scaffolder's grilling behavior or how grilling interacts with park-it / Requirements Summary known-unknowns.

## Permissions
Director's permissions for this repo live in the maintainer's local `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored).
